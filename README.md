# Instagram Catalogue
A Drupal 8 module that organizes Instagram posts based on hashtags.

This repo is a stripped down version of what it took to build the page [ArtOfMissKitty.com/gallery](https://artofmisskitty.com/gallery). For an explaination of what problems this module is trying to solve visit my page at [nilsloewen.ca/instagram](https://nilsloewen.ca/instagram). 

I do not intend to promote this module on Drupal.org as an offical contrib module. I have hosted this here mainly to show an example of my work of trying to solve a real-world problem as an exploratory personal project.

If you have any questions please feel free to message me.
